# Happiness Detection In Python Using OpenCV
This repository consists of code that can detect your happy and smily face through the webcam of your computer.

## OpenCV
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. Some applications of these algorithms include face detection, object recognition, extracting 
models, image processing, camera calibration, motion analysis etc.

OpenCV has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android.

### Face Detection
OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. The XML files of pre-trained classifiers are stored in opencv/data/. For face detection specifically, there 
are two pre-trained classifiers:
1.Haar Cascade Classifier
2.LBP Cascade Classifier
